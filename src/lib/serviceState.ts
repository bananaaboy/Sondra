 * answered by opening the right tab, switching the right toggle on and reading
 * a line halfway down a card. That is not an answer, that is a scavenger hunt.
 *
 * So the state moves out here, next to the other facts about this session, and
 * the capability strip can show it on every tab. Same subscribe-and-notify shape
 * as the FFmpeg status, for the same reason: several places need to read it and
 * none of them should own it.
