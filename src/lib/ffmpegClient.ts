/**
 * FFmpeg compiled to WebAssembly, running in the visitor's browser.
 *
 * How the pieces fit together
 * ---------------------------
 * `@ffmpeg/ffmpeg` is a thin RPC client. Calling `new FFmpeg()` gives you a
 * handle; `load()` spawns a dedicated Web Worker and hands it three URLs:
 *
 *   · coreURL   — the Emscripten JS glue for the ffmpeg core
 *   · wasmURL   — the compiled ffmpeg binary itself
 *   · workerURL — the pthread worker, multi-threaded core only
 *
 * Every `exec()` call is then forwarded to that worker, so transcoding never
 * blocks the UI thread. The worker owns an in-memory MEMFS filesystem: files are
 * written with `writeFile`, processed, and read back with `readFile`. Nothing is
 * ever sent anywhere — MEMFS lives in the tab's heap and dies with the tab.
 *
 * Why the URLs are imported rather than hard-coded
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * Most examples fetch the core from a CDN via `toBlobURL`. That would make every
 * visitor's browser announce itself to a third party on first use, which defeats
 * the point of this app. Instead both cores are dependencies, and Vite's `?url`
 * suffix emits them as ordinary hashed assets served from our own origin.
 *
 * Single-threaded vs multi-threaded core
 * --------------------------------------
 * `@ffmpeg/core-mt` is several times faster, but pthreads need SharedArrayBuffer,
 * which the browser only exposes to cross-origin-isolated documents (COOP +
 * COEP — see vite.config.ts and public/_headers). Where isolation is missing the
 * single-threaded core loads instead, and everything still works, just slower.

/**
 * What a file actually contains, according to FFmpeg.
 *
 * The browser answers this for free through a `<video>` element — but only for
 * the codecs it can play, and a Chromium build without H.264 or a Firefox
 * without system codecs will simply report a duration of zero. That silence is
 * indistinguishable from a broken file, and it leaves every control that needs
 * a length disabled with no explanation.
 *
 * So when the browser cannot answer, FFmpeg is asked. The obvious way — `-i`
 * with no output at all — is a trap in a WebAssembly build: ffmpeg treats
 * "nothing to do" as an error and calls `exit(1)`, and `exit` tears down the
 * whole runtime. The core survives the probe but every later run dies with
 * "null function or function signature mismatch", which looks like a bug
 * anywhere but here.
 *
 * Writing a tenth of a second to the null muxer instead ends with exit code 0
 * and prints the same stream information. The core is reloaded anyway if the
 * exit code is not 0, so a build without that muxer costs one reload rather
 * than a broken session.
